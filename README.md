# Neovim settings

This `nvim` folder is to be placed in `~/.config/`.
- most likely you will be replacing your existing `nvim` folder
- you can also create another config folder, e.g., `~/.config/nvim2/`, then placing the contents of this folder there, then create an `alias nvim2='NVIM_APP_NAME=nvim2 nvim'` in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Then you can use `nvim2` to run Neovim with the new configuration.
